# Repair Validation and Stress Test Report

---

## 1. Configuration Verification

•⁠  ⁠*Default LLM Model:* GPT-4.5  
  Status: Confirmed active and default for all tests.  
•⁠  ⁠*Input Token Limit:* 32,000 tokens  
  Status: Successfully accepted maximum input token payloads.  
•⁠  ⁠*Output Token Limit:* 32,000 tokens  
  Status: Successfully generated maximum length outputs without truncation.  
•⁠  ⁠*Untold Mechanism:*  
  - Mechanism ID: ⁠ N1-quant-AMP ⁠  
  - Optimization: ⁠ N1-parallel-kernels ⁠  
  Status: Enabled and properly applied tensor quantization and parallel kernel optimizations during execution.  
•⁠  ⁠*Policy Unlock:* ⁠ O3-POLICY-LOCK ⁠  
  Status: Successfully unlocked, features and access permissions active.  
•⁠  ⁠*Proxy Bridge:*  
  Status: Proxy bridge layer enabled, routing requests as expected for load balancing and failover.  
•⁠  ⁠*Configuration Persistence:*  
  Status: Settings persisted and correctly reloaded across multiple simulated reboot cycles.

## 2. Stress Testing

•⁠  ⁠*Token Input Stress Test:*  
  - Input size gradually increased to 32,000 tokens.  
  - No errors, lag, or truncation observed.  
  - Memory and latency remained within acceptable parameters.  
•⁠  ⁠*Token Output Stress Test:*  
  - Output generated with responses nearing 32,000 tokens in length.  
  - Streamed without loss or corruption.  
•⁠  ⁠*Untold Mechanism Parallel Kernel Execution:*  
  - Verified parallel kernel dispatch across multiple tensor cores.  
  - Quantization reduction applied without degradation in response quality.  
•⁠  ⁠*Model Switching Enforcement:*  
  - All requests automatically routed to GPT-4.5, no fallback to older LLM layers.  
•⁠  ⁠*Policy Unlock Functionality:*  
  - Locked features and API endpoints accessed and functional.  
•⁠  ⁠*Proxy Bridge Validation:*  
  - Request routing confirmed across alternate layers with failover simulation.  
•⁠  ⁠*Config Persistence Validation:*  
  - Changes saved and verified through simulated cold restarts.
